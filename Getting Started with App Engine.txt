 # Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

### Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
 - Initialize App Engine.
 - Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
 - Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
 - Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.
 
  ## Task 1: Initialize App Engine
  
		gcloud init
		gcloud config set account [ACCOUNT]
		gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
		
  
  1 Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
  
		gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
	
  2 Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
  
		git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
  
  3 Navigate to the source directory:
  
		cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
  
  ## Task 2: Run Hello World application locally
  
  1 Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.
  
		sudo apt-get update
  
  2 Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
  
		sudo apt-get install virtualenv
		
	If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.
	
		virtualenv -p python3 venv
  
  3 Activate the virtual environment.
  
		source venv/bin/activate
  
  4 Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
  
		pip install  -r requirements.txt
  
  5 Run the application:
  
		python main.py
	
	Please ignore the warning if any.
  
  6 In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.
  
  7 To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.
  
  8 Using the Cloud Console, verify that the app is not deployed. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App Engine > Dashboard.
  
		gcloud app instances list
  
  
  ## Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
  
  1 Navigate to the source directory:
  
		cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
  
  2 Deploy your Hello World application.
  
		gcloud app deploy
		
	If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
  
  3 Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
  
		gcloud app browse
  
  
  ## Task 4: Disable the application
  
  1 In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App Engine > Settings.
  
		gcloud app instances list
		gcloud app instances describe --service=s1 --version=v1 i1
  
  2 Click Disable application.
  
		gcloud app instances delete i1 --service=s1 --version=v1
  
  3 Read the dialog message. Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.
